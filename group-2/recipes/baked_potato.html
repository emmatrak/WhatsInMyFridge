        <li>Poke holes in your potato, then generously salt before air-frying your potato at 400°F until fully cooked, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add shredded or pieced-up cheese into a bowl with lots of ground black pepper, butter, and cooked bacon. If you have parsley or chopped garlic, add that now too. Also, add your butter and your sour cream. Save some of your cheese to top the potato.</li>
        <li>Scoop out the edges of your potato and leave a thin border, then add it into your bowl.</li>
        <li>Mix well, then add back into your potato husk.</li>
        <li>Top with your remaining cheese.</li>
        <li>Air fry your potato at 400°F for 5-8 minutes until the cheese is fully crispy.</li>
        <li>Eat and enjoy!</li>
